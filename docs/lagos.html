                    As the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread around the world, the Nigerian government took action to prevent its spread within the country. On January 28th, the government strengthened surveillance at five major airports, and a few days later the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Nigeria as a <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>high-risk country</strong> for the virus.

                    In February, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Nigeria, and a month later on March 30th, a nationwide lockdown was announced. This lockdown came with strict measures to limit the spread of the virus, such as reducing the capacity of buses to only <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>60%</strong> and prohibiting passengers from standing in public transportation.

                    During the lockdown, the population of Nigeria experienced decreased mobility and change to their old lives. Only a few weeks after the beginning of the lockdown the government had to begin lifting restrictions in Lagos due to the economic toll of the pandemic on the capital area and the rest of Nigeria. But how did this period of decreased mobility affect the citizens of Lagos and its various socioeconomic groups?

                    While Lagos implemented a short lockdown compared to other countries, other countries used different approaches to tackle the virus. Oxford University's COVID-19 Government Response tracker uses a measure called the <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Stringency Index</strong> to standardize and analyze the responses of low-middle income countries around the world. This measure has been used for the purpose of this article, and renamed to <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Lockdown Severity</strong>.

                    For this research an area defined as the <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Metropolitan area of Lagos</strong> has been used to analyze the impact of mobility restrictions on different socioeconomic groups. This area stretches over both the state of Lagos as well as Ogun, which were among the first to begin the lockdown. Estimating the population of Lagos is not a trivial task as keeping tabs of the slum population comes with a high uncertainty. Different sources estimate the population of Lagos to be anywhere between 14 million and up to 21 million, with about 66% of its population living in slums.

                    Although the large number of slum dwellers lowers the average income in Lagos, the city houses many millionaires and thus a very economically diverse population. Lagos has as a result been dubbed the “mega-city of slums”, even though the capital generates 25% of Nigeria’s GDP, which, as a result of the pandemic shrank with 3,53% in 2020.

                    The Nigerian government has been criticized for its lack of transparency regarding the use of public transportation in the Metropolitan area of Lagos. This lack of information poses a challenge for researchers looking to understand the impact of the recent lockdown on various socio-economic groups. However, studies show a correlation between living closer to city centers and having better access to public transportation, leading to increased job opportunities.

                    During the lockdown, many public transportation vehicles continued to operate at full capacity despite regulations. This suggests that the difference in mobility before and during the lockdown in Lagos will not be as drastic as in other countries, with high-income individuals using private transportation or staying at home while low- and middle-income individuals will be hit harder, although some may still use public transportation despite the lockdown measures.

                    As the public transportation of Lagos is highly unregulated and lockdown precautions not met, the change in usage of public transportation before and during the lockdown was not as drastic as in other countries. As the lockdown began, the number of commutes per day gradually decreased to approximately half of what it was before - in line with the official quarantine measures that allowed for 60% capacity in public transportation. This is visualized to the right, where the teal graph illustrates the number of daily trips in Lagos, while the gray graph visualizes Oxford's measure of lockdown severity.

                    By visualizing the change in mobility patterns for The Metropolitan area of Lagos, the differences between different socioeconomic groups can be lost. It is for this reason natural to dissect this graph and instead take a look at the wealth distribution of Lagos and their own responses to the lockdown.

                    As seen in the plot to the right, the average wealth in different areas of Lagos varies greatly. The darker the color of a data point, the richer the area. This visualization showcases the stark contrast between the income levels of those living in the city centers and those living in the outskirts of Lagos. The high number of people living in poverty and the very fluctuating salaries in Lagos means that the country is very economically segregated.

                  <p id="highlighted-text">
                    Due to lagoons and other bodies of water, some areas of the Metropolitan area of Lagos are uninhabitable, creating gaps in the data and visualizations. These bodies of water mean that transportation from these areas can be more tricky, indicating that we might see fewer commutes made from these areas than from the rural areas of the metropolitan area of Lagos.

                    Scientists from around the world have tracked data from citizens to study the impact of lockdowns on mobility. Due to anonymization and GDPR laws, the source of the data used in this research cannot be disclosed in this article. The graph to the right shows how people in Lagos commuted before COVID-19 hit Nigeria. Though this graph already paints a picture of how people living closer to city centers commute more, nothing too conclusive can be said. However, a comparison of the pre-lockdown and lockdown mobility patterns reveals a change in mobility.

                    By comparing three weeks of mobility data with a similar time frame after the nationwide lockdown in Nigeria began, the visualization shows a decrease in the number of trips made. This is likely due to the closure of workplaces, except for essential workplaces which tend to be located near city centers in Lagos. The graph also shows a pattern of more trips being made in and between the larger cities of Lagos than outside of the cities, indicating that those living outside of the cities may be more isolated and have an economic disadvantage.

                    The lockdown of Lagos put a damper on everyone's mobility, regardless of wealth as can be seen to the right. The bar chart shows how the lockdown impacted the mobility of each socioeconomic group. Each color represents the different socioeconomic groups, with the first bars depicting mobility before the lockdown and the second bars showing mobility after the lockdown began.

                    Interestingly, before the lockdown, the middle-income socioeconomic group of Lagos traveled more than the high-income group did. The lower number of commutes among the wealthier citizens can be a result of working status, e.g only working a few days a week or from home. At the same time, the low amount of commutes made by low-income citizens of Lagos is more likely correlated to how available transportation is and whether their jobs require them to commute.

                    After the lockdown of Lagos began, the mobility of the average and low-income population was affected disproportionately, as these socioeconomic groups had a bigger decrease in trips than those of high income. This chart shows the decrease in percentages for each economic group. The biggest change occurred in the average population of Lagos, which may be due to their dependence on public transportation even before the lockdown. With the closure of workplaces and public transportation, this group was hit the hardest. The high-income group decreased the least, likely due to their ability to use private cars instead.

                    This means that the average and low-income citizens of Lagos have a bigger disadvantage during unique circumstances such as pandemics or based purely on how far away from the city center they live. It is important for governments to take into account how lockdowns can unevenly affect a large portion of a population and how this pandemic has created a wide gap between the different socioeconomic groups in many low-middle-income countries around the world. Finding a solution to this problem is not simple, but spreading the knowledge of the disadvantages is an important step in the right direction.
