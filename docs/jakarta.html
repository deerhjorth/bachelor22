                    As Indonesia confirmed its first cases of COVID-19, the government took steps to prepare for the pandemic, including increasing the availability of masks and promoting social distancing measures. In response to the rapid spread of the virus, Indonesia implemented its first <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Large-Scale Social Restriction (PSBB)</strong> on April 9th, with some provinces, such as Jakarta applying to implement their own mobility restrictions the month prior. The PSBB advised people to stay at home except for essential and medical purposes and limited public transportation capacity to <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>50%.</strong>

                    Compared to countries like Italy and China, Indonesia never went into a full lockdown. Instead, their restriction policies urged people to follow some guidelines and banned international travel. With PSBB, provinces could apply to the Minister of Health to implement their own local mobility restrictions. This was done by Jakarta at the end of March, where the new restriction only allowed for <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>60 people per train car</strong> and changed the number of trains and buses present during rush hours. But how did this period of decreased mobility affect the citizens of Jakarta and its various socioeconomic groups?

                    While Indonesia handled the pandemic differently than other countries, they still implemented COVID-restrictions that partially paralyzed the country. Oxford University's COVID-19 Government Response tracker uses a measure called the <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Stringency Index</strong> to standardize and analyze the responses of low-middle-income countries around the world. This measure has been used for the purpose of this article, and renamed to <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Lockdown Severity.</strong>

                    The metro area of Jakarta, also known as <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Jabodetabek</strong>, is a large region covering the capital of Indonesia as well as parts of the surrounding provinces of West Java and Banten. With a population of over <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>30 million</strong>, Jabodetabek is a major hub of economic growth in Indonesia. However, a significant number of its residents live in poverty, with many working as street vendors and relying on their own mobility as well as the mobility of wealthier individuals who purchase their products.

                    According to official data from 2011, <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>5.82%</strong> of the population of Jabodetabek lived in poverty. However, the pandemic has exacerbated this situation, with over half a million workers in Jakarta city alone losing their jobs in the first six months of the crisis. To define three socioeconomic groups in Jabodetabek - low, average, and high income - the relative wealth of individuals living in the same region is used as an average. In Jakarta, the average annual income is just above <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>6,500 USD.</strong>

                    Residents of rural areas in Jabodetabek have limited access to transportation, making it difficult for them to access job opportunities with better working conditions in city centers. In 2015, only about 1.4 million people commuted from rural areas to Jakarta daily. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic not resulting in a complete lockdown of public transportation in Jabodetabek, the number of commuters traveling from rural to urban areas is likely to decrease significantly due to a decrease in job opportunities in urban centers. However, as citizens of Jakarta primarily use cars for commuting, we will see that the remaining commuters will continue to travel the same distance to their workplaces, but with reduced density due to the decrease in overall commutes and open workplaces.

                    As Jakarta implemented its own mobility restrictions on the <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>23rd of March</strong>, a drastic decline in the number of commutes began, stagnating a few weeks later after the official PSBB period began in Indonesia. The number of commutes dropped <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>below 50%</strong> for this period - in line with the official mobility restrictions that only allowed for 50% capacity in public transportation. This is visualized to the right, where the teal graph illustrates the number of daily trips in Jabodetabek, while the gray graph visualizes Oxford's measure of lockdown severity.

                    By visualizing the change in mobility patterns for Jabodetabek, the differences between different socioeconomic groups can be lost. It is for this reason natural to dissect this graph and instead take a look at the wealth distribution of Jabodetabek and their own responses to the lockdown.

                    The <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>average wealth</strong> in Jabodetabek generally increases as the distance to the city center of Jakarta decreases. This relationship is illustrated in the plot on the right, with richer areas indicated by darker colors. The visualization highlights the disparity in income levels between those living in the city center and those living on the outskirts of Jabodetabek. The correlation between wealth and proximity to the city center means that restrictions on mobility and closures of workplaces may disproportionately affect lower-income residents, who rely on daily income and already face disadvantages in terms of commuting from the outskirts of Jabodetabek. The presence of mountains near the edges of Jabodetabek makes some areas uninhabitable, resulting in gaps in the data and visualizations.

                    Scientists from around the world have <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>tracked data</strong> from citizens to study the impact of lockdowns on mobility. Due to anonymization and GDPR laws, the source of the data used in this research cannot be disclosed in this article. The graph to the right shows how people in Jabodetabek commuted before COVID-19 hit Indonesia. Though this graph already paints a picture of how people living closer to city centers commute more, nothing too conclusive can be said. However, a comparison of the pre-lockdown and lockdown mobility patterns reveals an interesting change in mobility.

                    By comparing three weeks of mobility data from before and after the Large-scale Social Restriction period in Indonesia began, we can see a significant decline in the number of trips made. The trips that were taken during the PSBB period did not appear to be shorter or more localized, but the overall number of trips decreased significantly. The visualization also shows that there were still more trips being made within and between the larger cities of Jabodetabek than outside of these cities. This indicates that the already low number of commutes from rural to urban areas decreased even further during the social restriction period, suggesting that either people from these rural areas were unable to commute to the city centers, or they did not have a need to do so during the restriction period.

                    Diving deeper into the influence of mobility restrictions on the residents of Jabodetabek, a distribution of commutes made by each socioeconomic group appears. Both the high, middle, and low-income citizens of Jabodetabek were limited in their mobility during the PSBB period, as can be seen in the bar chart to the right. Each color represents a socioeconomic group, the first bar being mobility before lockdown and the second bar after lockdown.

                    Prior to the lockdown, the high-income population commuted more than both the low- and middle-income population did. This means that it is expected that this socioeconomic group will be affected the least, as they have easier access to private transportation, compared to their less wealthy counterparts. But surprisingly, this is not the case.

                    After the PSBB period began in Jabodetabek, the mobility of the low- and average-income population was surprisingly affected less than the mobility of the wealthier population. This chart shows the decrease in percentages for each economic group.
                  </p>
                  <p id="highlighted-text">
                    Though the low-income socioeconomic group was affected the least, this does not mean that they were the least affected by the pandemic. As many street vendors lost their incomes during the pandemic and over half a million workers were laid off, it can be assumed that this socioeconomic group was actually hit the worst both mentally and physically. While the low-income population had no choice but to stay home, or keep trying to go to the city for possible work, people of higher income had more flexibility with working remotely, as was advised by the government of Jakarta. 
                  </p>

                    This means that although the mobility of the high-income socioeconomic group was affected the most, this cannot exclusively be used as a measure of how well a socioeconomic group handled the pandemic. As mentioned earlier, the low-income population of Jabodetabek lost jobs and incomes, and struggled with poverty as a result of the pandemic. This means that unique circumstances such as pandemics and improper access to transportation can give a major disadvantage to people with lower incomes. It is important for governments to take into account how lockdowns can unevenly affect a large portion of a population and how this pandemic has created a wide gap between the different socioeconomic groups in many low-middle-income countries around the world. Finding a solution to this problem is not simple, but spreading the knowledge of the disadvantages is an important step in the right direction.
