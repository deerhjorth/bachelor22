                    As the media's focus on the pandemic wanes, the long-term effects of the crisis continue to impact the world's population. To date, the pandemic has claimed the lives of over 6.6 million people and resulted in more than 650 million confirmed cases.

                    Low-income populations were disproportionately affected by the crisis. The loss of jobs, loved ones, and the ability to move freely has had a significant impact on their mental and financial well-being.
