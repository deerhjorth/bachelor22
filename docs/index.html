                    As the first confirmed cases of Indian citizens with COVID-19 started to roll in, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, expressed his concerns via Twitter on the 22nd of March, 
                    where he urged the citizens of India to follow the concept of <strong class="highlighted-strong">Janta Curfew</strong>. This curfew exhorts people to stay inside their homes from 7AM till 9PM, unless they’re deemed to be essential workers. This would become the first step of a very extreme nationwide lockdown of India, that would soon change everybody’s lives.

                    At this point in time, India was still facing the decision to either choose to preserve people’s livelihoods or instead try to curb the spreading of the virus. Faced with a daunting decision, the Indian government chose to prioritize the lives of its 1.38 billion citizens by implementing a four-phase lockdown from March 24th to May 31st, 2020. During these long and isolated 68 days, millions of citizens of Delhi, as well as all other parts of India, showed decreased mobility and experienced huge changes compared to their old lives. But how did this period of decreased mobility affect Delhi's citizens and its various socioeconomic groups?

                    The COVID pandemic wreaked havoc on India, decreasing the GDP per capita by almost 7% from 2019 to 2020. To analyze the different responses to the virus, Oxford University's COVID-19 Government Response Tracker created a new measure, called the Stringency Index. This measure has for this article been renamed to <strong class="highlighted-strong">Lockdown Severity</strong> and applied to low-middle-income countries to understand their varying responses to the virus.

                    The <strong class="highlighted_strong">National Capital Territory of Delhi</strong> is a union territory of India, with over 20 million citizens. Aside from being India's largest city, Delhi is also home to a large portion of slum dwellers. Though the exact number of people living in poverty in these slums is uncertain, this number has been reported to lie between <strong class="highlighted-strong"> million people.</strong>

                    The low-income citizens of Delhi, who often rely on manual labor and owning small shops, are severely impacted by restrictions on movement. Unlike their wealthier counterparts, they lack the luxury of working remotely or taking paid time off, making their ability to earn a living even more precarious. Although the large number of slum dwellers lowers the average income in Delhi, this state still had an average income almost three times higher than the national average. This average was used to decide how to divide the data of Delhi into poor, average, and rich.

                    By living closer to the city centers of Delhi, you gain easier access to public transportation and greater job opportunities with better working conditions. Despite only 25% of Delhi's population commuting over 10km to work daily, a significant number of people walk to their jobs. This means that during the COVID lockdown, trips will likely remain localized as those walking to work are less affected by transportation restrictions than those who rely on buses, trains, and cars every day.

                    The sudden implementation of India's first lockdown on March 24th caused a drastic change in Delhi, with citizens forced to stay home. Before the lockdown, the average number of <strong class="highlighted-strong"> daily commutes</strong> in Delhi was twice as many as during the first period of lockdown, as shown in the comparison graphs to the right. The teal graph illustrates the total amount of daily trips in Delhi, while the gray graph visualizes Oxford's measure of lockdown severity.

                    By visualizing the change in mobility patterns for all of Delhi, the differences between different socioeconomic groups can be lost. It is for this reason natural to dissect this graph and instead take a look at the wealth distribution of Delhi and its response to the lockdown.

                    Seen to the right is a plot visualizing the average wealth in different parts of Delhi. The darker the color, the richer the area. This plot reveals that those living in city centers have higher incomes than those in the outskirts. This corresponds with studies showing that living outside of cities leads to economic disadvantages. This means that limiting mobility and enforcing lockdowns on public transportation will affect different socioeconomic groups in Delhi differently due to their already segregated nature.

                    Scientists from around the world have <strong class=”highlighted-strong”> tracked data </strong> from citizens to study the impact of lockdowns on mobility. Due to anonymization and GDPR laws, the source of the data used in this research cannot be disclosed in this article. The graph to the right shows how people in Delhi commuted before COVID-19 hit India. Though this graph already paints a picture of how people living closer to city centers commute more, nothing too conclusive can be said. However, a comparison of the pre-lockdown and lockdown mobility patterns reveals a significant change.

                    By comparing three weeks of mobility data with a similar time frame after the nationwide lockdown in India began, the visualization looks completely different. The trips made during lockdown are shorter and more local and the number of trips has declined heavily. The commutes shown in this graph are still showing a pattern of more trips being made in and between the larger cities of Delhi than outside of the cities, which might indicate that people living outside of the cities are more secluded and can therefore have a larger economic disadvantage.

                    The lockdown in India's capital, Delhi, has disproportionately affected the city's poor, with a bigger decrease in trips taken by this socio-economic group than compared to those with higher incomes. This chart shows the decrease in percentages for each economic group. The strict lockdown, the <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Janta curfew</strong>, and subsequent closure of public transportation and workplaces likely played a role in this decrease, as the low-income population were left without options for travel.

                    These factors also had a negative effect on the average and wealthy population, though due to their working status, they might either be considered essential workers, have private cars, or simply, have the luxury of working from home. This decrease in mobility can be linked to the decrease of India’s GDP, which shrank by 7,3% in 2020, as due to the lockdown people were not able to work and generate wealth.

                    This means that poorer people of Delhi have a bigger disadvantage during unique circumstances such as pandemics or based purely on how far away from the city center they live. It is important for governments to take into account how lockdowns can unevenly affect a large portion of a population and how this pandemic has created a wide gap between the different socioeconomic groups in many low-middle-income countries around the world. Finding a solution to this problem is not simple, but spreading the knowledge of the disadvantages is an important step in the right direction.
