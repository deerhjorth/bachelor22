                    On March 6th, 2020, the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in Colombia. As more cases emerged, the country declared a health emergency on March 12th. In response, President Iván Duque implemented decisive measures to protect the elderly population and the further spread of the virus, including mandatory isolation for adults over the age of 70 and the closure of the country's borders.

                    As the virus continued to spread, Colombia announced a nationwide lockdown on March 20th, starting on March 24th. This initial <strong class=”highlighted-strong”> 19-day lockdown </strong> was extended six times, ultimately lasting a total of 161 days. During this time, all inter-municipal transport was forbidden and public transportation within cities was only allowed to run at <strong class=”highlighted-strong”> 35% </strong> capacity. Municipalities across the country also took action to enforce their own additional precautions.

                    In the capital city of Bogotá, Mayor Claudia Lopez implemented a gender-based quarantine measure known as <strong class=”highlighted-strong”> Pico y género </strong>, where women were only allowed to leave their homes for essential tasks on even-numbered days, and men on odd-numbered days. These measures sparked widespread protests and discrimination against certain population groups. During the lockdown, many citizens were left struggling financially as Colombia’s economy had suffered greatly, with the GDP of the country shrinking by 7%.

                    While Colombia implemented strict lockdowns, other countries took varying approaches to tackle the virus. Oxford University's COVID-19 Government Response tracker uses a measure called the <strong class=”highlighted-strong”> Stringency Index </strong> to standardize and analyze the responses of low-middle-income countries around the world. This measure has been used for the purpose of this article, under the name <strong class=”highlighted-strong”> Lockdown Severity. </strong>

                    The <strong class=”highlighted-strong”>Metropolitan area of Bogotá</strong> is a territory consisting of land from the Department of Cundinamarca and Bogotá D.C., with many people commuting between its different cities each day and is therefore often the focus of studies on the capital city. With over 12 million citizens, this area houses a high number of people living in slums and poverty. Though hard to estimate, it’s expected that over 12% of the population lived in poverty in 2018, a figure that has likely risen in the wake of the pandemic.

                    The rapid growth of the city has left many poor families struggling in cramped and unstable urban slums. Studies have shown that Bogotá contributed with more than 1 million citizens who entered monetary poverty due to the high levels of unemployment caused by the pandemic. The average salary in Bogotá in 2020 was reported to be around 4000 USD, a figure that was used to define what is considered low, average, or high income in the Metropolitan area of Bogotá.

                    Living closer to the city centers of Bogotá provides easier access to public transportation, enabling residents to pursue higher-paying jobs with better working conditions. In Bogotá city, it is estimated that around 40% of the population uses public transportation, and 31% walk to their destination. While these numbers may not be exactly the same for the Metropolitan area, they provide a good indication of how people tend to commute. This means that during the COVID lockdown, trips will likely remain localized as those walking to work are less affected by transportation restrictions than those who rely on buses, trains, and cars every day.

                    The sudden implementation of Colombia’s first lockdown on March 24th caused a drastic change in Bogotá, with citizens forced to stay home. As the lockdown started the number of commutes per day dropped below 30%, - in line with the official quarantine measures that allowed for just 35% capacity in public transportation. This is visualized to the right, where the teal graph illustrates the number of daily trips in Bogotá, while the gray graph visualizes Oxford's measure of lockdown severity.

                    As seen in the plot to the right, the average wealth in different areas of Bogotá varies greatly. The darker the color of a data point, the richer the area. This visualization showcases the stark contrast between the income levels of those living in the city centers and those living on the outskirts of Bogotá.

                    Due to the high altitude of Bogotá, many areas are uninhabitable, creating gaps in the data and visualizations. These rural areas are often isolated and lack proper access to public transportation, making it difficult for residents to commute to the cities for work and other necessities. This lack of mobility and access to urban centers has negative economic implications for those living in these areas. In times of crisis, such as during lockdowns, these disadvantaged groups may be disproportionately affected since they are already so segregated.

                    Scientists from around the world have tracked data from citizens to study the impact of lockdowns on mobility. Due to anonymization and GDPR laws, the source of the data used in this research cannot be disclosed in this article. The graph to the right shows how people in Bogotá commuted before COVID-19 hit Colombia. Though this graph already paints a picture of how people living closer to city centers commute more, nothing too conclusive can be said. However, a comparison of the pre-lockdown and lockdown mobility patterns reveals a significant change.

                    The lockdown measures prevented people from commuting between districts, leading to localized trips within the cities of the Metropolitan area of Bogotá. While this might suggest that the outskirts were most affected by the lockdown, the areas with the biggest changes in mobility were actually those within Bogotá city and the other large cities. But in order to identify meaningful findings, we must examine the change in mobility for each socioeconomic group.

                    Both the high-, middle-, and low-income citizens of Bogotá were limited in their mobility during the lockdown, as can be seen in the bar chart to the right. Each color represents a socioeconomic group, the first bar being mobility before lockdown and the second bar after lockdown.

                  <p id="highlighted-text">
                    Before the lockdown, the mobility of low-income citizens of Bogotá was already much lower compared to the mobility of higher-income citizens. This, unrelated to the pandemic, is still a societal and infrastructural problem as the average and high-income population live closer to Bogotá’s Bus Rapid Transit, making commuting more accessible in these areas.

                    As a result, the difference in mobility for each socioeconomic group in the Metropolitan area of Bogotá was actually the smallest for the poor, though the differences between the groups are quite small. The decrease in mobility for the middle and rich population might be a result of better options for remote work as President Iván Duque urged companies to arrange remote working options if possible.

                    This means that poorer citizens in the metropolitan area of Bogotá have less flexibility during unique circumstances such as pandemics or based purely on how far away from the city center they live and which job positions they have. It is important for governments to take into account how lockdowns can unevenly affect a large portion of a population and how this pandemic has created a wide gap between the different socioeconomic groups in many low-middle-income countries around the world.  Finding a solution to this problem is not simple, but spreading the knowledge of the disadvantages is an important step in the right direction.
